			<h1>Masada and the Dead Sea</h1>
			<p>This day began bright and early at 7, when Hillel picked us up from our AirBnB
outhouse in Jerusalem. We promptly set out for Masada, an ancient ruin
overlooking the Dead sea that was once held by Jews and conquered by the Romans
in 73 or 74 AD. Before we got there, we made brief stops at the sea level
marker (the dead sea is 423 meters below sea level) and a little gas station
market. When we got there we bought tickets and prepared for our walk up the
front of the mountain that Masada resides upon. We took the "snake" path up the
mountain, which derives its name from its numerous switchbacks. I decided to
get some exercise by power walking up the path, and in the process took off my
shirt and sweat a lot. Right after I got to the top, a tram-load of old
tourists happened to come up at the same time, all of whom took great delight
in laughing at me, calling me 'Americano', and taking pictures. I was too tired
and hot to do anything but laugh back at them; it was probably a hilarious
scene to have observed. After waiting for Hillel and Hannah to make their way
up, we began a thorough tour of the ruins.</p>

<p>One of the more salient points that Hillel made was that the beauty of
Masada lays in the life that its Jewish inhabitants maintained before their
end, not in their tragic end itself. The (compacted) story of Masada is that it
was made into a fortified hideout by the paranoid roman king Herod, captured by
Jewish rebels in 66 AD, and then largely destroyed by a roman siege around 73
AD. When the Jewish rebels realized their eventual defeat upon running out of
ammunition, they decided to commit mass suicide instead of submit to capture
and enslavement by the Romans. While the story of Masada is very powerful, I
tend to agree with Hillel. Life in ancient Masada was surprisingly rich and
comfortable, for living in the middle of a desert 2,000 years ago. The
facilities built straight into the mountain for bathing, food storage, defense,
and most impressively water collection were absolutely fascinating and
ingenious. I couldn't believe that the Romans were able to create a fully
functional city housing thousands of soldiers on top of a mountain in a desert.
Solely utilizing technology from over 2,000 years ago, Masada's inhabitants
could store years worth of food, have a steady stream of water, and even have
the luxury of hot baths. Also, the Jewish rebels converted the roman horse
stables into a synagogue. To honor the spirit of Masada, the synagogue is still
used. I'm not sure how much its actually used or what its used for (its quite
small), but when we visited it we saw a rabbi inside making copies of the
torah. Masada was definitely a high point of the day.</p>

<p>Our next stop was Ein Gedi, which is a little area north of Masada that
has pretty vegetation and a stream running through it. Like Masada, Ein Gedi is
surrounded by barren desert. We went for a short walk up the stream and I swam
around in a cold pool around the base of a small waterfall. Cool stuff. We then
moved onto the dead sea. It seems obligatory that when one goes to Masada one
also goes to float in the Dead sea. They are right next to each other, and if
you buy enough Aveda skin care products at the base of Masada you are granted
free entrance to a little spa + dead sea resort. We did this, taking the
opportunity to buy gifts for our parents. The resort was packed with
exclusively birthright attendees, most of which were probably of the age group
18-22. Hillel also leads birthright trips, and shared with us earlier that he
isn't too fond of that age group (apparently most American 18-year-olds want to
drink more than learn about Israel, go figure). We followed along with the
hordes of birthrighters and floated in the dead sea, doused ourselves in mud,
floated again, and changed and left. It was very touristy and crowded and weird
being with young birthrighters, but it was something we were obligated to do.
Also, actually being in the dead sea was surreal. It has around a 33% salt
content, which makes you unexpectedly buoyant. I felt like a wine cork bobbing
around in normal water; it would've been hard to submerge your entire body
(although you wouldn't want to, because the salty water burns your eyes).
Around 3 in the afternoon, we started to make our way back towards Jerusalem.
We stopped at the Jordan river in hopes of witnessing baptisms (people believe
Jesus was baptized there), but we just missed a tour bus full of
freshly-baptized Christians. We also briefly stopped at a Bedouin outpost along
the side of the highway and took pictures. </p>

<p>We got back to Jerusalem and then had to bid Hillel farewell. Hillel was
by far the best person I could've imagined to introduce me to Israel. He was
instantly our friend, and we got the opportunity to discuss so much more than
just history and key points about sites of interest. I can't even begin to
describe how fantastic of a guide Hillel was, nor even enumerate the qualities
that made him so good. After saying our goodbyes, we headed out to a little
restaurant that Hillel recommended and I nearly fell asleep while eating.
Utterly exhausted, we caught a cab home and passed out immediately. </p>
